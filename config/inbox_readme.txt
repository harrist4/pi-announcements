CHURCH ANNOUNCEMENTS DROP FOLDER

1. What this folder is for
   - Drop PDF, PowerPoint (.pptx), or image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) here.
   - Best practice: export PowerPoint to PDF before dropping it here.
     * Direct PowerPoint conversion may substitute fonts.
     * Exporting to PDF preserves fonts and layout.
   - Everything added within about a minute is treated as one “set.”
   - That set completely replaces the current announcement slides.

2. How it works
   - When you add or modify files, the system waits briefly for uploads to finish.
   - It then converts the files and updates the TV slides.
     Large PDFs or PowerPoints may take several minutes.
   - All files you drop here are deleted after processing.
   - Current live slides can be viewed in the “announcements_live” share.

3. Marker files
   - _READY.txt means this folder is idle and ready for new content.
   - _PROCESSING.txt means a conversion run is active.
   - Do not edit or remove these files.

If the TV display looks incorrect, empty this folder and re-upload your slides.
If issues continue, please contact the tech team.
