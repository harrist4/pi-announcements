CHURCH ANNOUNCEMENTS DROP FOLDER

1. What this folder is for
   - Drop PowerPoint files (.pptx) and image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) here.
   - The Raspberry Pi will convert them into a slide show for the TV.

2. How it works
   - When you add or change files, the system waits about a minute for things to “settle.”
   - It then converts all files and updates the TV slides.
   - All files you drop here will be deleted after processing.
   - The current live slides (read-only) are available on the “announcements_live” share.

3. Marker files
   - _READY.txt means the folder is idle and ready for new content.
   - _PROCESSING.txt means a conversion run is in progress.
   - Please do NOT edit or delete these marker files.

If something looks wrong on the TV, clear this folder and try again.
If problems continue, contact the tech team.
