CHURCH ANNOUNCEMENTS DROP FOLDER

1. What this folder is for
   - Drop PDF, PowerPoint (.pptx), or image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) here.
   - Best practice: export PowerPoint to PDF before dropping it here.
     * Direct PowerPoint conversion will substitute fonts.
     * Exporting to PDF keeps your fonts and layout correct.
   - Everything dropped within about a minute is treated as one "set."
   - This set replaces the current Announcement slides.

2. How it works
   - When you add or change files, the system waits about a minute for things to settle.
   - It then converts everything and updates the TV slides. Large PDFs may take several minutes.
   - All files you drop here will be deleted after processing.
   - The current live slides are available on the "announcements_live" share.

3. Marker files
   - _READY.txt means the folder is idle and ready for new content.
   - _PROCESSING.txt means a conversion run is in progress.
   - Do not edit or delete these files.

If something looks wrong on the TV, clear this folder and re-upload your slides.
