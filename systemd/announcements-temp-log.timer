# announcements-temp-log.timer
#
# Purpose:
#   Periodically trigger the announcements-temp-log.service to record
#   CPU temperature at a fixed cadence.
#
# Behavior:
#   - First run occurs shortly after boot
#   - Subsequent runs occur every 5 minutes
#   - Uses Persistent=true so missed runs are caught up after downtime
#
# Notes:
#   - Cadence chosen to balance trend visibility and log size
#   - AccuracySec allows systemd to coalesce wakeups if needed
